## Unsolved Problems
- I used CSS after I wrote my code, but with the Bulma framework, it seems theres specific heirarchy for modals that I didn't have with how I wrote my code. This resulted in not being able to do modals
- I wasnt able to include an edit function for the app that would allow the user to try their hand at a quiz again for a better score after a while
